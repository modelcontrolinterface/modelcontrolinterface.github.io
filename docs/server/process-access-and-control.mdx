# Process Access & Control

Once created, processes remain accessible throughout their lifecycle. You can query their state, retrieve execution data, and control their behavior through dedicated operations.

---

## Retrieving Process Information

### View a Single Process
Retrieve complete information about a specific process, including its definition, current status, exit state, environment, and timestamps.

### List Multiple Processes
Query processes with filtering and pagination. You can filter by:
- Status (queued, running, completed)
- Exit state (success, failed, terminated)
- Environment
- Creation and completion time ranges
- Name, description, or PID search

This enables auditing execution history, monitoring active processes, and analyzing outcomes across environments.

---

## Execution Artifacts

Process execution produces two types of data, accessed separately:

### Logs
Diagnostic traces from execution including stdout, stderr, and timestamps. Use logs for debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing.

### Output
Structured result data produced by the process. The format depends on what the process generates. Use output to retrieve computation results, processed data, or generated reports.

Keeping logs separate from output ensures diagnostic traces don't mix with meaningful result data.

---

## Lifecycle Control

### Control Signals
Send signals to manage process execution:

**startup** — Begin execution
**instantiate** — Initialize without running
**kill** — Terminate execution
**restart** — Stop and start again

Signals control runtime behavior without changing the process definition itself.

---

## Modification and Deletion

### Partial Updates
Modify specific process fields without replacing the entire definition. Only the fields you provide are changed; everything else remains the same.

**Restriction:** You cannot modify a running process.

### Deletion
Permanently remove a process and all associated data.

**Restriction:** You cannot delete a running process.

---

## State Protection

Running processes are protected from modification and deletion. These operations return a conflict error if attempted while the process is running.

**Why:** Changing or removing a running process would corrupt execution state and produce inconsistent results.

**Safe workflow:**
1. Send the `kill` signal to stop execution
2. Wait for the process to complete
3. Perform your modification or deletion

This ensures execution integrity and prevents state corruption.

---

## Error Conditions

Operations may fail for several reasons:

**Not Found** — Process doesn't exist
**Unauthorized** — Missing or invalid credentials
**Forbidden** — Insufficient permissions
**Conflict** — Operation not allowed in current state (e.g., modifying running process)
**Validation Error** — Invalid input data or failed linting
**Server Error** — Unexpected system error

Each error includes a descriptive message and relevant details to help diagnose the issue.
