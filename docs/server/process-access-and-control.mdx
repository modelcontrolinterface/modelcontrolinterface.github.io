description: "Understanding process lifecycle management"

Processes remain accessible throughout their entire lifecycle. Query state,
retrieve execution data, and control behavior through the dedicated endpoints
described below.

## Retrieving Process Information

Use the following endpoints to inspect processes:

- **[List all processes](/api-reference/process/list-all-processes)** - Query
  processes with filtering and pagination support
- **[Get process details](/api-reference/process/get-process-details)** -
  Retrieve complete information for a specific process

These endpoints enable auditing execution history, monitoring active processes,
and analyzing outcomes across environments.

## Execution Artifacts

Process execution produces two distinct data types, accessed through separate
endpoints:

### Logs

Diagnostic traces including stdout, stderr, and timestamps. Use logs for
debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing.

**Endpoint:**
[Get process execution logs](/api-reference/process/get-process-execution-logs)

### Output

Structured result data produced by the process. The format depends on the
process implementation. Use output to retrieve computation results, processed
data, or generated reports.

**Endpoint:**
[Get process output data](/api-reference/process/get-process-output-data)

Keeping logs separate from output ensures diagnostic traces do not mix with
meaningful result data.

## Lifecycle Control

Send control signals to manage process execution:

| Signal | Action |
| - | - |
| `startup` | Begin execution |
| `restart` | Stop and start again |
| `kill` | Terminate execution |
| `instantiate` | Initialize a new process without running |

**Endpoint:**
[Send a signal to a process](/api-reference/process/send-a-signal-to-a-process)

Signals control runtime behavior without changing the process definition.

## Modification and Deletion

### Partial Updates

Modify specific process fields without replacing the entire definition. Only
provided fields are changed; all others remain unchanged.

**Endpoint:** [Update process](/api-reference/process/update-process)

### Deletion

Permanently remove a process and all associated data.

**Endpoint:** [Delete process](/api-reference/process/delete-process)

<Danger>
  **State Protection**

  You cannot modify or delete a running process. These operations return a
  conflict error if attempted while the process is running.

  **Why:** Changing or removing a running process would corrupt execution state
  and produce inconsistent results.

  **Safe workflow:**

  1. Send the `kill` signal to stop execution
  2. Wait for the process to complete
  3. Perform your modification or deletion

  This ensures execution integrity and prevents state corruption.
