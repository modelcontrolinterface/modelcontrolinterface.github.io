  <Accordion title="What is MCI actually providing?" icon="message-circle-question-mark">
    MCI is an open-source, **protocol-agnostic** system.
    Clients connect to an MCI server, which then handles all communication and
    execution logic with end services. It acts as the "operating system" for
    model-driven actions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does the “code” look like?" icon="message-circle-question-mark">
    MCI doesn't force a proprietary language (DSL) on you. It uses
    **language modules** that translate specifications into standard libraries.

    This means models can write tasks in Python, JavaScript, or any language
    the runtime supports.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What makes MCI more secure and observable?" icon="message-circle-question-mark">
    MCI utilizes **interceptor modules** that function like middleware. These
    modules can inspect every dispatch made by the code to block, redirect, or
    log actions. For example, a Permissions Interceptor can cross-reference an
    action against a security policy before execution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is MCI execution stateful?" icon="message-circle-question-mark">
    Yes. While MCP relies on the model’s limited context window to "remember"
    state, MCI shifts state management to the code and the runtime. This keeps
    the model's context clear and makes tool interactions significantly more
    reliable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does MCI interact with the existing MCP ecosystem?" icon="message-circle-question-mark">
    MCI is designed to complement, not replace, MCP. To MCI, MCP is simply
    another protocol standard, much like REST or JSON-RPC. An MCI server can
    act as a bridge to existing MCP servers, giving you the best of both worlds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is MCI trying to replace tool calling?" icon="message-circle-question-mark">
    Not at all. MCI still utilizes tool calls, but it enables **multi-step,
    stateful** execution. Instead of the model performing one tool call at a
    time in a "chat" loop, it can chain and parallelize multiple calls
    within a single execution block.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why not just extend MCP to do this?" icon="message-circle-question-mark">
    MCP is a communication standard. Incorporating these features would require
    redefining its core principles, likely breaking existing implementations.
    While third-party wrappers could add *some* of this functionality to MCP,
    they cannot match the native security and efficiency of a purpose-built
    control interface.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is MCI opinionated about hosting or deployment?" icon="message-circle-question-mark">
    No. MCI is infrastructure-neutral. Whether you are running on-prem, in the
    cloud, or on embedded devices, MCI is compatible as long as the host
    environment can enforce the execution contract.
