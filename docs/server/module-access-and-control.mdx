## Module Life-cycle

Modules are long-lived components that MCI discovers, loads, communicates with,
and coordinates during runtime. The module life-cycle defines how modules are
installed, initialized, and integrated into an active MCI instance.

### Installation

Installation makes a module discoverable to MCI. At this stage, modules are
not running and have no active connection to the server.

There are 2 ways by which modules can be installed with MCI;

- Installation by instantiating
- Installations over Registries

#### Installation by instantiating

Installation by instantiating allows users to add a modules by manually
providing the details for a module.

This can be done by making a POST request to `/modules` with the details for
the module.

```python
import requests

files = { "wasm_file": ("example-file", open("example-file", "rb")) }

payload = {
    "id": "<string>",
    "name": "<string>",
    "type": "sandbox",
    "description": "<string>",
    "source_url": "<string>"
}

response = requests.post(url, data=payload, files=files, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

[Reference the API reference](https://modelcontrolinterface.mintlify.app/api-reference/module/create-a-new-module)

#### Installations over Registries

Modules can also be installed from a registry, for this you must simply make a
`POST` request to `/modules/install` with the registry entry URI.

```python
import requests

payload = { "url": "<string>" }

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

### Module Initialization

Initialization occurs when MCI loads an installed module into an active
instance. During this phase, the module becomes operational and establishes its
relationship with the MCI server.

For a module to be initialized by MCI it first must be enabled. This is also
done by a `PUT` request `/modules/{id}` and setting the `enabled` field to
true.

With this, when MCI start up, it looks for all enabled moduled and tries to
initialize it, however, for a module to be successfully initialized, it must
pass the configuration validation process.

### Module Configuration

Every module may register a set of configuration fields, this allows modules
to collect input from the user to guide the initialization process. This data
may range from API secretes, preferences, constraints and additional
information.
