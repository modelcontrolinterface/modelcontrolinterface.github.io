A process is the fundamental unit of execution in MCI. It represents a single,
explicit request for the server to execute a body of code under a defined set
of constraints-encompassing execution environment, timeouts, permissions,
resource limits, and other metadata that ensures safe and deterministic
execution.

## How Processes Work

1. **Generation**: A model produces code that interacts with external tools
2. **Packaging**: The client extracts the generated code and bundles it with
  execution metadata (environment selection, timeout values, resource limits)
3. **Execution**: The client sends a `POST` request to `/processes`, the server
  creates a new process with a unique Process ID (PID), and executes the code
  within the declared constraints
4. **Completion**: The server returns outputs, logs, and execution state upon
  completion or failure

### Session bound processes

All processes initialized are session bound by default, this means, from moment
a session is creates, is persists at real-time and as long as the MCI server
instance is online, these processes will continue to exists.

This allows clients to run processes and re-run them in instances where they
failed, conditions changes or additional context is provided without using much
output tokens and bulky requests. It also allows past processes to be modified
and run as different instances in different conditions.

### Routines processes

The model or user may want a process to exist for long periods of
times and maybe over multiple sessions. These special processes are called
**routines**. When saved, the process code becomes reusable, allowing models to
trigger the same logic from other processes and pass data between them.

Think of routines as executable `SKILLS.md`: the model constructs modular
processes that can be invoked across different contexts, enabling composable,
repeatable workflows.
