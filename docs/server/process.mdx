## Processes

A process is the fundamental unit of execution in MCI. It represents a single,
explicit request for the server to execute a body of code under a defined set
of constraints-encompassing execution environment, timeouts, permissions,
resource limits, and other metadata that ensures safe and deterministic
execution.

### How Processes Work

1. **Generation**: A model produces code that interacts with external tools
2. **Packaging**: The client extracts the generated code and bundles it with
  execution metadata (environment selection, timeout values, resource limits)
3. **Execution**: The client sends a `POST` request to `/processes`, the server
  creates a new process with a unique Process ID (PID), and executes the code
  within the declared constraints
4. **Completion**: The server returns outputs, logs, and execution state upon
  completion or failure

Once created, a process can be terminated at any time via
`DELETE /processes/{pid}`. This makes processes ideal for long-running,
background operations.

### Routines

Processes can be persisted-either before execution or after completion-creating
**routines**. When saved, the process code becomes reusable, allowing models to
trigger the same logic from other processes and pass data between them.

Think of routines as executable `SKILLS.md`: the model constructs modular
processes that can be invoked across different contexts, enabling composable,
repeatable workflows.
