MCI (Modular Computing Interface) is, at its core, a server and runtime manager. It accepts connections from clients attempting to execute tasks-but without modules, it cannot interpret instructions, manage dispatches, or communicate with external services.

Modules make MCI truly _modular_. They extend your instance to support different instruction languages, connect to new protocols and standards, manage permissions, and more.

## Types of Modules

Modules serve specialized functions across five categories:

| **Module Type** | **Primary Function**                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sandbox**     | Provides a secure, isolated environment (container, VM, or shell) where scripts execute. Mounts a shared directory for code and dependencies.   |
| **Proxy**       | Acts as a reverse proxy for communicating with external services using specific protocols and standards such as `REST`, `GraphQL`, or `gRPC`.   |
| **Interceptor** | Middleware that sits between scripts and services. Handles logging, security filtering, request modification, and other cross-cutting concerns. |
| **Language**    | Generates language-specific libraries that models use to execute actions within sandboxes and send dispatches back to the MCI server.           |
| **Hook**        | Event-driven peripherals that expose servers for external notifications (e.g., GitHub webhooks) to trigger model actions.                       |

### Sandbox Modules

Sandboxes provide isolated environments for code execution-whether Docker/Podman containers, online execution platforms, Nix shells, or local environments.

A functional sandbox must satisfy three requirements:

1. **Code Execution**: The environment must include all necessary tools and dependencies to run the target code.
2. **Directory Mounting**: The sandbox must mount a read-only directory containing generated code and libraries. MCI, working with language modules, prepares this directory, which can be mounted via the host filesystem or Network File System (NFS).
3. **MCI Communication**: The sandbox requires a lightweight client to send requests and receive responses from MCI during action dispatches.

When code executes, it communicates back to MCI, requiring network access. Sandboxes should restrict network traffic **exclusively** to the configured MCI server address.

### Proxy Modules

Each proxy module enables communication over specific protocols with defined definition. For example, a proxy might handle `REST` endpoints over `HTTP`.

Proxy modules must implement two capabilities:

1. **Proxy Instantiation**: Expose a function allowing MCI to create proxy instances. Each proxy acts as a client-server hybrid that transforms MCI calls into appropriate requests for target servers.
2. **Definition Translation**: Ingest specification files (e.g., `OpenAPI`) and return structured data describing available requests, expected responses, and schemas. This structure enables generation of language-specific library bindings.

## Interceptor Modules

Interceptors inspect and modify outgoing requests and incoming responses. They enable request logging, permission enforcement, request redirection, and on-the-fly modifications during transit.

### Language Modules

Language modules generate the libraries that models use to perform actions. They consume definition data from proxy translations and convert it into language-specific bindings. MCI manages these libraries as files that sandbox modules reference during execution. Before running code, MCI injects the appropriate library, enabling dispatches back to the MCI server.

### Hook Modules

Hook modules are event servers. When loaded, they start a server on a configured address and wait for external requests such as webhooks. Upon receiving a request, the server forwards the data to subscribed clients for processing.
